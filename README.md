# ALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS

Welcome to All I Want For Christmas - the app that allows you to keep a record of all the gifts that you need to get during the busy holiday season and 'tick them off' once they have been bought.

Quite often whilst shopping or searching the internet, people see some items and think 'Ooh, that would be a great gift for Grandma, or if at the shops and you can't pick up a gift due to the gift recipients being present, then keeping an up-to-date list is one way of ensuring nothing is left in the shops - no mad dash on Christmas Eve to make sure that everyone's wish list has been met!

This app would be useful for anyone buying gifts during Christmas time - most people will be trying to keep a record of gifts ideas, and gits bought in the run up to Christmas Day. Searches can be made to see who the gifts are for, how much they cost, what items are being bought and where to buy them. It means that the gift list can be filtered to show all items needed at a particular shop without having to scroll through all the items.

Users will also be able to delete gifts if they no longer need to buy them, gifts can be edited if thiings such as prices or where to buy changes.

Here's the link to the deployed site: <https://all-i-want-for-christmas-11c6c44413ce.herokuapp.com/>

## UX

The ideas for designing the app was that it was a simple, and quick way to be able to record the gift ideas without over complicating the process. Often when seeing a good idea of a gift, people will think - I must remember this, but then when it comes to birthdays and christmas, they've forgotten what to get. Also, most people when shopping can be in a rush or busy, therefore finding a way of noting these gifts in a simple, and quick manner was paramount.

Another main feature for the app is that once the gifts have been added, they can be filtered by recipient, gift item or where to buy. This will be especially useful when rushing around the shops at Christmas - for example is someone were to find themselves in a shop like John Lewis - a quick search for 'John Lewis' will bring up all the gifts that need to be bought from thet specific shop, thus saving valuable time,

### Colour Scheme

With it being a christmas themed app, traditional colours of green and red were chosen for the main theme of the app along with christms themed imges such as Santa and Christmas lights.

- `#7cb342` used for the nav bar on all pages
- `#078021` used for primary title page text
- `#000080` used for title pages
- `#000000` used for list text

### Typography

Font Awesome was used extensively for the icons on the forms, on buttons and for the holly on the main welcome page.

Google fonts was used for various fonts throughout the app.

- [Delicious Handrawn](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Delicious+Handrawn) was used for the brand logo - white font was chosen to make it look like snow.

- [Amatic SC](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Amatic+SC) was used for the main welcome page text as it is a nice clean font.

- [League Script](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/League+Script) was used for the titles of most pages. This was chosen to make it look like it was hand-written in pen, just as someone would do when writing lists.

- [Grandstander](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/grandstander) was used for the flash messagesand the footer due to is clear and clean appearance.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as form field icons.

### Future Features

There is a lot of potential for this app. Some of the future features that can be made to expand on the app could be as follows:

- Shared Lists
  - Family or friends can share lists so that the responsibility of buying gifts for family can be shared amongst more than the original gift list creator. For emample - both parents could have access to certain lists so that both can buy gifts for the children.
- Reminders
  - Reminders could be set up - last international posting dates, last date for online orders to be made.
- Christmas Traditions Lists / Reminders
  - If your family/household has Christmas/ Christmas Eve traditions - these can be placed in the list as a reminder. Things such as; decorate the tree, milk and snacks for Santa, get Christmas PJs ready etc.
- Christmas Lunch lists / reminders
  - Christmas lunch is one of the most important parts of the day. List and reminders can be set up for things like - christmas food shop, turkey pick up day, what needs preparing in advance etc.
- Christmas Cards List
  - Christmas cards lists can be set up to keep track of cards to be sent. This can include links to addresses / e-mail addresses for e-cards and gift vouchers.

## Tools & Technologies Used

Here are the tools and technologies that was used to produce the All I want For Christmas app.

- [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) used for the main site content.
- [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) used for the main site design and layout.
- [CSS Flexbox](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp) used for an enhanced responsive layout.
- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com) used for user interaction on the site.
- [Python](https://www.python.org) used as the back-end programming language.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com) used for version control. (`git add`, `git commit`, `git push`)
- [GitHub](https://github.com) used for secure online code storage.
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) used for hosting the deployed front-end site.
- [CodeAnywhere](https://codeanywhere.coom) used as a cloud-based IDE for development.
- [Materialize](https://materializecss.com) used as the front-end CSS framework for modern responsiveness and pre-built components.
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com) used as the Python framework for the site.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) used as the non-relational database management with Flask.
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) used for hosting the deployed back-end site.

## Database Design

My project uses a non-relational database with MongoDB, and therefore the database architecture
doesn't have actual relationships like a relational database would.

My database is called **all_i_want_for_christmas**.

It contains 2 collections:

- **gifts**
    | Key | Type | Notes |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | _id | ObjectId() | |
    | list_name | String | |
    | gift_item | String | |
    | cost | String | |
    | where_to_buy | String |
    | created_by | String | selected from the *users* collection |
    | bought | Boolean | |

- **users**
    | Key | Type | Notes |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | _id | ObjectId() | |
    | username | String | |
    | password | String | uses Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) |

## Testing

For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

## Deployment

The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://all-i-want-for-christmas-11c6c44413ce.herokuapp.com).

### MongoDB Non-Relational Database

This project uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) for the Non-Relational Database.

To obtain your own MongoDB Database URI, sign-up on their site, then follow these steps:

- The name of the database on MongoDB should be called **insert-your-database-name-here**.
- The collection(s) needed for this database should be **insert-your-collection-names-here**.
- Click on the **Cluster** name created for the project.
- Click on the **Connect** button.
- Click **Connect Your Application**.
- Copy the connection string, and replace `password` with your own password (also remove the angle-brackets).

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set your environment variables.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | user's own value |
| `IP` | 0.0.0.0 |
| `MONGO_DBNAME` | user's own value |
| `MONGO_URI` | user's own value |
| `PORT` | 5000 |
| `SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |

Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy properly.

- requirements.txt
- Procfile

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:

- `echo web: python app.py > Procfile`
- *replace **app.py** with the name of your primary Flask app name; the one at the root-level*

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:

- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
  - `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level,
and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps, plus a few extras.

The sample `env.py` file should look like the following:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("IP", "0.0.0.0")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DBNAME", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("PORT", "5000")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DB_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
os.environ.setdefault("DEVELOPMENT", "True")
```

#### Cloning

You can clone the repository by following these steps:

1. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/D3lyth/all-i-want-for-christmas)
2. Locate the Code button above the list of files and click it
3. Select if you prefer to clone using HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI and click the copy button to copy the URL to your clipboard
4. Open Git shell or Terminal
5. Change the current working directory to the one where you want the cloned directory
6. In your IDE Terminal, type the following command to clone my repository:
	- `git clone https://github.com/D3lyth/all-i-want-for-christmas.git`
7. Press Enter to create your local clone.

Alternatively, if using CodeAnywhere, you can click below to create your own workspace using this repository.

[Open in CodeAnywhere](https://d3lyth-all-i-want-for-ch-zj550np1g5.us2.codeanyapp.com/#/workspaces/all-i-want-for-christmas)

#### Forking

By forking the GitHub Repository, we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original owner's repository.
You can fork this repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/D3lyth/all-i-want-for-christmas)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. Once clicked, you should now have a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account!

### Local VS Deployment

I have compaared both versions extensively and form what I can see There are no differences between local version and the live site deployed on Heroku.
